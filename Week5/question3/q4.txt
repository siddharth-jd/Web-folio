Let's Manipulate

In this question we will use javascript to manipulate html files provided.

There is one sample.html file provided to you, which has its script linked to dom.js. 
You need to write your code in dom.js, to manipulate the html webpage as follows:

1. For all images (with <img> tag), change the source of the image to be timepass.png

2. Delete all the <h1> heading tags. (Remember, no other headings should get deleted.)

3. For all paragraphs (with <p> tags), change the content of the paragraphs to be "Enough of JavaScript, lets stop."

4. Change all the <h2> content to make it uppercase. So, suppose you have a h2 heading saying Dont Stop, 
then it should be converted to DONT STOP

5. For any <div> container with element id = div1, add a heading (<h3>) with no text inside it.



All these changes will happen when you click the Change button. 
The change button in your html file will call a function in your javascript code. So, you need to edit that function in dom.js.

Once you click the Evaluate button, the results will be shown after a few seconds, so please wait.
