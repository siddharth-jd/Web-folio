JavaScript as a Programming Language
In this question, you need to find the largest prime number which is less than or equal to the number which is received as input.
The HTML code is already provided to you in the file basic.html. 
You need to write javascript code in the same file, and submit. (If there is no prime number less than or equal to the given number, just print 0.) 
(Also, your final result string should be stored in the paragraph with id "result", see the HTML Code for you reference!)
